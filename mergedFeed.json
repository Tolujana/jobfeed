\"title\": \"Logistic Officer\",\n  \"description\": \"CFL Group was established in 1998 with the founding of NEXT TECHNOLOGY NIGERIA LIMITED, a telecommunications company that provided internet services to a growing customer base. The company was founded by Engr. Lai Omotola. Over the next nine years, CFL Group expanded significantly, incorporating an additional 14 companies to form the diversified conglomerate known today as CFL Group. In 2015, CFL Group transitioned into a full-fledged infrastructure company with interests spanning Real Estate, Energy, Power, Construction, Agriculture, and Transportation. As a wholly indigenous Nigerian company headquartered in Lagos, CFL Group is committed to contributing to the nation&amp;rsquo;s development across multiple sectors.\n\nOne of the key subsidiaries of CFL Group is&amp;nbsp;Masters Reality, a leading real estate company in Nigeria, incorporated in 2010. Since its inception, Masters Reality has focused primarily on commercial real estate development. However, in 2025, the company strategically integrated both residential and commercial projects to better serve the evolving needs of the Nigerian market. With Nigeria currently facing a housing deficit of approximately 28 million units, Masters Reality has committed to addressing this gap by developing 1 million housing units. This ambitious goal will be executed in phases, with the understanding that even this significant contribution is but a drop in the ocean.
