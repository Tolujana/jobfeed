Company provides private chef service to customers across Nigeria.\n\nWe are recruiting to fill the position below:\n\nJob Position: Personal Assistant (P.A)\nJob Location: Lekki / Ikate, Lagos (Proximity is essential)\nEmployment Type: Full-time\n\nDescription\n     \n\n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\tAt Rentachef NG, we don't just provide food; we curate culinary experiences.\n\tFrom intimate private dinners to high-profile catering, we are redefining what it means to dine well in Lagos.\n\tTo keep our engine running smoothly, our CEO needs a sharp, high-energy, and deeply organized Personal Assistant to act as their right hand and brand ambassador.\n\n\nWhat You’ll be Doing\nYour mission is to clear the path so the CEO can focus on growing the brand\nYour day-to-day will involve:\n\n\n\tOrchestrating the Day: You’ll manage the CEO’s calendar like a pro—scheduling meetings, client consultations, and visits, ensuring the day flows logically and reminders are never missed.\n\tThe Voice of the Brand: You’ll be the first point of contact for our clients, vendors, and partners. Whether you’re answering calls or drafting polished emails, you’ll handle every interaction with grace and professionalism.\n\tLogistics & Travel: Whether it’s booking a flight or navigating through Lagos traffic for a high-priority meeting, you make sure the CEO gets there on time and stress-free. You are responsible for ensuring the CEO isn't just \"on the way,\" but arrives calm, prepared, and ahead of schedule, despite the unpredictability of traffic.\n\tBusiness Backbone: You’ll handle the \"behind-the-scenes\" essentials—preparing presentation decks for corporate pitches, taking meeting notes, and conducting research.\n\tThe Personal Touch: No two days are the same. You might find yourself assisting with personal shopping or managing private appointments to ensure the CEO’s personal and professional lives stay in balance.\n\n\nWho You Are?\n\n\n\tA Lekki/Ikate Resident: You live close to the action. We value your time, and we know that living near Ikate or Lekki means you’ll spend less time in traffic and more time making an impact.\n\tWell-Educated: You hold a degree in Business Administration, Mass Communication, Marketing, English, Economics, or Finance. You know how to apply your academic background to real-world business challenges.\n\tSharp & Detailed: You have a \"detective’s eye\" for detail. Whether it’s a contract or a dinner menu, you spot the errors others miss.\n\tA Natural Problem-Solver: When a vendor is late or a schedule shifts last minute, you don’t panic. You think on your feet and find a workaround.\n\tDiscreet & Trustworthy: You’ll be handling sensitive business and personal information. To you, confidentiality isn’t just a rule—it’s a habit.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\tInterested candidates should possess a Bachelor's Degree with at least 2 years experience.\n\n\nWhy Rentachef
