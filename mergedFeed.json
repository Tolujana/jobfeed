experiences and keeping operations running smoothly.\n\tYou’re not afraid to get into the details — spotting gaps, solving problems and finding better ways to work.\n\tReporting to our Senior People Operations Manager, you’ll be the go-to person for our Nigeria team, helping to bring LemFi’s culture to life on the ground.\n\tFrom onboarding new joiners to organising events, managing office logistics and supporting engagement initiatives, you’ll play a key role in making LemFi a great place to work.\n\n\nDay-to-day responsibilities\n\n\n\tOwn the local onboarding experience — coordinate first-day logistics and help new starters feel part of the LemFi community.\n\tPlan and deliver on-the-ground employee events (all hands, celebrations, team-building, volunteering, wellness days, etc.) to strengthen engagement and connection.\n\tSupport local culture and communications, ensuring LemFi’s values come to life in the Nigeria office and beyond.\n\tPartner with the global People Team to roll out engagement, learning and well-being initiatives in Nigeria.\n\tAct as the first point of contact for employees locally — answering questions about policies, time off, travel or general support.\n\tCoordinate with vendors and service providers (benefits, workspace and events) to ensure smooth operations.\n\tMaintain accurate employee records and ensure compliance with Nigerian employment regulations in collaboration with the Senior People Operations Manager.\n\tSupport local hiring logistics, scheduling interviews and helping candidates have a positive experience.\n\tAssist with HR documentation and compliance tasks where needed.\n\tContribute ideas and feedback to help improve employee experience and ways of working at LemFi.\n\n\nWhat we’re looking for\n\n\n\tYou’re friendly, proactive, and hands-on — equally comfortable planning an event or solving a problem on the spot.\n\tYou communicate clearly and empathetically, building trust and rapport with team members.\n\tYou’re organised and detail-oriented and able to juggle multiple priorities smoothly.\n\tYou enjoy creating connections and culture — you notice what makes people feel valued and find ways to make work more engaging.\n\tExperience in events coordination or office management.\n\tFamiliarity with Nigerian labour practices and working in a global company is a plus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you'll gain by joining our team\n\n\n\tThe opportunity to shape LemFi’s employee experience in Nigeria — from onboarding to events and culture.\n\tExposure to global people operations and best practices within a high-growth fintech\n\tMentorship from an experienced People Team and the chance to grow into a broader People Operations or HR role over time.\n\tThe satisfaction of creating an environment where people feel connected, supported, and proud to work.\n    \n\n    \n\n        Click here to Apply  \n        \n\n    \n     \n\n\n\n\n        \n
