It commenced operations in June 2010 upon obtaining a Unit Microfinance Banking License from the Central Bank of Nigeria. It later obtained a State Microfinance Banking License in 2016. Bosak Microfinance Bank Limited’s financial inclusion effort focuses on promoting savings culture, access to credit facilities for income-generation purposes and reducing vulnerability to risk through micro insurance.\n     \n\n            \n    \n\n\n\nThe Bank’s major strategic focus employs the group lending methodology in its operations with a leaning towards women. It believes in the commitment of women folk to work hard and help their families conquer poverty. As such, more than 95% of the Bank’s lending activities focuses on women. The success of the bank’s group lending activities largely depends on group solidarity and cohesion. The success recorded by the bank in its lending program has earned it strategic partnership with the Bank of Industry (BOI) and the Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN) among others. The combination of cutting-edge technology, a strong and committed Board of Directors and motivated employees has helped the Bank to create a brand widely accepted by its teeming clients in Lagos.
