Through building impactful partnerships and programmes, NewGlobe ensures that all children have access to an education that will develop their full potential and create a foundation for growth and prosperity.\n\nNewGlobe leverages more than a decade of educational experience and proven impact in integrated school management, teacher professional development, instructional design innovation, technological system support, child-centered classroom practice, and parent engagement -&amp;nbsp; all grounded in learning science - to ensure each teacher is empowered to engage children in transformational learning, and all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. Every day, NewGlobe supports governments to solve what were once seen as intractable problems, and by doing so, ensures this generation will be able to grow up to lead more fulfilled lives, while simultaneously building economic prosperity for themselves, their communities, and the globe.\n\nWe are recruiting to fill the position below:\n\nJob Position: Senior Data Engineer\n\nJob Location:&amp;nbsp;Lagos\n\nAbout the Role\n\n\n\tNewGlobe has been data-driven from its inception, using a build-measure-learn approach to all aspects of service delivery.\n\tAs a scale model business, we have an unprecedented opportunity to bring statistical power to all aspects of an educational operation, from the academics team using randomized controlled trials to validate the best teaching methods to the schools team understanding which factors contribute to teacher turnover to operational teams striving to improve our service delivery efficiency.\n\tHowever, we have reached an inflection point where we need to take our data game to the next level. Instead of just providing data to our various departments, we need to start bringing to bear more sophisticated techniques to unlock the potential of our significant data sets.\n\tWhile we collect tens of thousands of data points every term from each of our academies &amp;ndash; from the time spent on each page of a lesson to the billing and payment history of every pupil &amp;ndash; we are yet to fully realize the potential energy of these data sets.\n\tWe&amp;rsquo;re looking to build our next generation Data Platform team in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, alongside our software and product teams.

Instead of just providing data to our various departments, we need to start bringing to bear more sophisticated techniques to unlock the potential of our significant data sets.\n\tWhile we collect tens of thousands of data points every term from each of our academies – from the time spent on each page of a lesson to the billing and payment history of every pupil – we are yet to fully realize the potential energy of these data sets.\n\tWe’re looking to build our next generation Data Platform team in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, alongside our software and product teams.
