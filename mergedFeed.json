and polish to make content dynamic and memorable.\n\n\nCreative Storytelling & Brand Alignment:\n\n\n\tTranslate creative briefs into scroll-worthy content and social-first visuals.\n\tHelp maintain a consistent brand tone across all formats (visual, motion, video).\n\tSupport marketing campaigns with strong content ideas and flexible design execution.\n\n\nCollaboration & Execution:\n\n\n\tWork
