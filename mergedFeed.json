management services space. Our aim over the years has been to provide complete real estate services. These include the sale and lease of residential and commercial properties, and long-term property management within Nigeria and Internationally.\n\nFrom our early days of operation, we have focused on using technology to compete and create a niche for ourselves in the Nigerian real estate industry. Unfortunately, we had to step down to a more analogue approach if we were to work with other stakeholders in the real estate space in Nigeria. We dare say that, Vestates was ahead of its time in that regard.\n\nOver time we have grown to possess a large network of clients, nationally and internationally, including work methods with a stable structure, enforced by a highly skilled and upright team. The corona virus pandemic (COVID-19) has indirectly exposed how dependent the world is on technology, to transmit information among other things; same importance is applicable to our business and cannot be overstated. Technology has now been brought back to our focus, thereby sponsoring seamless growth in our operations scale.\n\nWe are recruiting to fill the position below:\n\nJob Position: Business and Procurement Manager\n\nJob Location:&amp;nbsp;Abuja (FCT)&amp;nbsp;\nEmployment Type: Full-time\nReports to: Managing Director\n\nJob Purpose\n\n\n\tThe Procurement &amp;amp;

Business Development:\n\n\n\tWork with the sales team to drive revenue growth through acquisition and retention of clients (restaurants, hotels, caterers, and individuals).\n\tSet sales targets, monitor performance, and implement strategies to exceed targets.\n\tExplore new business opportunities and expand the company&amp;rsquo;s customer base.\n\n\nCustomer Service &amp;amp; Client Relations:\n\n\n\tOversee customer service operations to ensure excellent client experiences.\n\tEnsure prompt resolution of customer complaints and issues.\n\tMonitor customer feedback and use insights to improve service quality and product offerings.\n\n\nOperational Efficiency &amp;amp;

Our aim over the years has been to provide complete real estate services. These include the sale and lease of residential and commercial properties, and long-term property management within Nigeria and Internationally.\n\nFrom our early days of operation, we have focused on using technology to compete and create a niche for ourselves in the Nigerian real estate industry. Unfortunately, we had to step down to a more analogue approach if we were to work with other stakeholders in the real estate space in Nigeria. We dare say that, Vestates was ahead of its time in that regard.\n     \n\n            \n    \n\n\n\nOver time we have grown to possess a large network of clients, nationally and internationally, including work methods with a stable structure, enforced by a highly skilled and upright team. The corona virus pandemic (COVID-19) has indirectly exposed how dependent the world is on technology, to transmit information among other things; same importance is applicable to our business and cannot be overstated. Technology has now been brought back to our focus, thereby sponsoring seamless growth in our operations scale.\n\nWe are recruiting to fill the position below:\n\nJob Position: Business and
