Clear vision creates opportunities for increased learning, work, safety, civic participation, and quality of life. As a social enterprise, social change motivates us first. Our focus on sales and revenue targets serves and advances our mission objective&amp;mdash;to increase functioning, productivity, and income earning potential for our low-income consumers by correcting refractive error and presbyopia with eyeglasses. We are working to transform the systemic dysfunction of an optical market that has failed to deliver eyeglasses&amp;mdash;a 700-year-old technology&amp;mdash;to 2.7 billion consumers in need of vision correction, most of whom live on less than $4 a day.\n\nWe serve low-income consumers, not as beneficiaries but as customers. Our customers expect a high-quality and affordable product, and they will spend limited discretionary income for the immediate and tangible benefits of vision correction. By selling eyeglasses, we awaken new demand and seed a viable market. By selling new eyeglasses we are able to serve four times as many people per dollar input than the alternative of donating recycled ones. To efficiently scale, we must deliver each new unit at a lower cost. We run our business on both sales metrics and social impact measures.

Our focus on sales and revenue targets serves and advances our mission objective—to increase functioning, productivity, and income earning potential for our low-income consumers by correcting refractive error and presbyopia with eyeglasses. We are working to transform the systemic dysfunction of an optical market that has failed to deliver eyeglasses—a 700-year-old technology—to 2.7 billion consumers in need of vision correction, most of whom live on less than $4 a day.\n     \n\n        \n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n    \n    \n\n\n\nWe serve low-income consumers, not as beneficiaries but as customers. Our customers expect a high-quality and affordable product, and they will spend limited discretionary income for the immediate and tangible benefits of vision correction. By selling eyeglasses, we awaken new demand and seed a viable market. By selling new eyeglasses we are able to serve four times as many people per dollar input than the alternative of donating recycled ones. To efficiently scale, we must deliver each new unit at a lower cost. We run our business on both sales metrics and social impact measures. We use a range of organizational forms and practices to get the job done. We believe in scaling our impact, not our organization. We are a lean team of doers.\n\nWe are recruiting to fill the position below:\n\nJob Position: IT Support Personnel (DigitEYES)\n\nJob Location: Nigeria\n\nJob Responsibilities\n\n\n\tAs our IT
