Nigeria. The company specializes in the export of solid minerals and agricultural products, sourcing the finest raw materials from local markets to meet international demand. Neveah has now expanded into manufacturing, focusing on the recycling of aluminum and copper to produce ingots for export, further strengthening its global footprint.\n\nWe are recruiting to fill the position below:\n\nJob Position: Inventory Accountant\n\nJob Location:&amp;nbsp;Mowe (Lagos-Ibadan Express Way), Ogun\nEmployment Type: Full-time\nDepartment:&amp;nbsp;Finance / Accounts\nJob Field:&amp;nbsp;Manpower\nReport to:&amp;nbsp;Cost Accountant\nIndustry: Recycling\n\nBackground\n\n\n\tWe seek to hire a qualified and technically competent Inventory Accountant its Aluminium and Copper Ingots Manufacturing Plant.\n\tThe factory, which is based in Mowe [Lagos-Ibadan Express Way], Ogun state will primarily recycle a broad range of scrap materials and convert them to usable Aluminium and Copper Ingots for different manufacturing purposes.\n\tThe Inventory Accountant is responsible for managing and maintaining accurate inventory records, analyzing cost variances, and ensuring compliance with accounting standards in a manufacturing environment.\n\tThis role involves working closely with production, procurement, and finance teams to monitor inventory transactions and improve inventory management processes.\n\n\nResponsibilities\nThe ideal candidate will (but is not limited to):\n\n\n\tMaintain accurate records of inventory transactions, including raw materials, work-in-progress, and finished goods.\n\tConduct periodic inventory reconciliations and ensure proper valuation of inventory.\n\tMonitor and analyze inventory variances, investigate discrepancies, and implement corrective actions.\n\tAssist in the development and implementation of inventory control procedures.\n\tWork closely with the operations team to improve inventory accuracy and minimize losses.\n\tPrepare monthly, quarterly, and annual inventory reports for management review.\n\tAnalyze cost of goods sold (COGS) and ensure correct allocation of production costs.\n\tAssist in the month-end and year-end closing processes by providing necessary inventory data.\n\tEnsure compliance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and company policies.\n\tCoordinate with auditors to support inventory-related financial audits.\n\tSupport ERP system implementation and improvements related to inventory management.\n\n\nKey Deliverables\n\n\n\tAverage Inventory Level: Provide a clear representation of the mean stock level throughout the fiscal year\n\tOrder Lead Time / Order Cycle Time: Measure the total time it takes for products to reach customers. It is counted from the moment customers put in an order to the moment they receive the finished product.\n\tInventory Turnover Rate:Theinventory turnover ratemeasures the frequency at which you sell your entire stock. In other words, it returns the percentage of total stock that you managed to sell in each period. Tracking this KPI provides a ratio of sales to the amount of inventory in stock.\n\tStock-to sales ratio / Inventory-to-sales ratio: This compares the average inventory value of a given time with finished sales for the period. The stock-to-sales ratio is important to keep at a balanced level &amp;ndash; too low is indicative of an increased risk of stockouts: too high, however, means tighter profit margins due to mounting storage costs.\n\tDays Sales of Inventory:This measures the average time it takes for stock to be sold and therefore, how long cash is tied up in stock. A low days sales value correlates with faster turnover and, among other things, can be a good indicator of stockout risk.\n\tCarrying Cost of Inventory signifies all of the overhead costs that you incur by holding inventory in stock. The metric returns a percentage which, naturally, you want to aim to be as low as possible, whilst covering all bases.\n\tBackorder Rate: The backorder rate is a KPI that details the percentage of incoming orders that could not be fulfilled for a given time period. It is calculated simply by dividing the number of incoming orders that you weren&amp;rsquo;t able to complete by the total number of incoming orders. Backorder rate is an easy metric, high values of which reliably point towards lax supply chain management or planning practices.\n\tSell-through Rate: The sell-through rate KPI returns the percentage of stock that you&amp;rsquo;ve sold relative to the total available stock for sale for a given product. It is a useful metric for quickly evaluating the selling performance of stock items and can be used to adjust production volumes or replenishment accordingly.\n\n\nQualifications\n\n\n\tBSc Degree in Accounting or Finance\n\tMinimum of 6 years of proven working experience as Inventory Accountant\n\tMust have manufacturing industry experience\n\tProfessional certification is required; ICAN and other relevant certifications.\n\tRequire experience in ISOs\n\tExperience with inventory cycle counting and physical stock audits.\n\tKnowledge of lean manufacturing principles and supply chain management.\n\tFamiliarity with regulatory compliance and tax implications related to inventory\n\tAdvanced computer skills on MS Office, accounting software and databases.\n\n\nRequired Competence:\n\n\n\tTechnical Skills: Proficiency in accounting software (SAP, Oracle, QuickBooks, or similar ERP systems). Strong Excel skills, including VLOOKUP, pivot tables, and financial modeling.\n\tKnowledge: Understanding of cost accounting, standard costing, and inventory valuation methods (FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Average).\n\tAnalytical Skills: Strong problem-solving skills with the ability to analyze financial data and generate insights.\n\tCommunication: Excellent written and verbal communication skills with the ability to collaborate across departments.\n\tAttention to Detail: High level of accuracy and strong organizational skills to manage multiple tasks effectively.\n\tWork Ethics: Ability to work independently and meet deadlines in a fast-paced manufacturing environment.\n\n\nMethod of Application\nInterested and qualified candidates should send their updated CV saved in their full name to:&amp;nbsp;careers@neveah.com.ng&amp;nbsp;using the Job Position as the subject of the mail.\n\nNote: Only properly submitted applications and qualified candidates will be considered.\",\n  \"datePosted\": \"2025-08-20\",\n  \"validThrough\": \"2025-09-04\",\n  \"employmentType\": \"Full-Time\",\n  \"hiringOrganization\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Organization\",\n    \"name\": \"Neveah Limited\"\n    \n  },\n  \"jobLocation\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Place\",\n    \"address\": {\n      \"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",\n       \"postalCode\": \". \",\n       \"addressRegion\": \". \",\n       \"streetAddress\": \". \",\n      \"addressLocality\": \"Ogun\",\n      \"addressCountry\": \"NG\"\n     \n      \n    }\n  },\n  \"identifier\": {\n    \"@type\": \"PropertyValue\",\n    \"name\": \"\",\n    \"value\": \"186110\"\n  },\n  \"baseSalary\": {\n    \"@type\": \"MonetaryAmount\",\n    \"currency\": \"NGN\",\n    \"value\": {\n      \"@type\": \"QuantitativeValue\",\n      \"minValue\": 0,\n      \"maxValue\": 0,\n      \"unitText\": \"MONTH\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nInventory Accountant Job at Neveah Limited\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n\n        \n        Neveah Limited is a leading commodity trading company established in 2014, with its head office in Abuja and five operational offices across Nigeria.
