IOM is dedicated to promoting humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all. It does so by providing services and advice to governments and migrants.\n\nWe are recruiting to fill the position below:\n\nJob Position: Project Assistant, Shelter - NFI\n\nJob Identification: 16225\nJob Location: Maiduguri, Borno\nJob Schedule: Full time\nGrade: G-5\nContract Type: Special Short Term Graded (Up to 9 months)\n\nContext\n     \n\n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\tBesides forced displacement and deepening humanitarian needs that are predominant in Nigeria, States such as Anambra, Delta, Rivers, Cross River and Bayelsa, Adamawa, Gombe, Jigawa, parts of Kaduna, Kogi, Niger, and Benue also face extreme vulnerabilities as a result of hydro-meteorological hazards such as floods and drought, and the ever-increasing competition for resources.\n\tThe impact of climate change is exacerbating local farmer-herder tensions as floods and droughts become increasingly regular and intense. \n\tSince 2009, the insurgency in the Northeast involving several armed groups has resulted in widespread violence, displacement of over two (2) million people, and humanitarian crises, with significant social, economic, and political impacts on the affected communities and the country.\n\tThe region has also faced environmental degradation, resource competition, and land use competition, further exacerbating tensions. According to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), as of February 2023, Nigeria is currently hosting 3.57 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) due to armed conflicts and other drivers of displacement.\n\tThe tensions between farmers and herders, exacerbated by the increasing issues of accessing water and land, are forcing the population in Southeast, North-central and Northwest into internal displacement. Malnutrition, and waterborne diseases, including cholera, continue to plaque mobile populations in fragile contexts.\n\tThe nature and scale of forced displacement in the country present humanitarian and development challenges, that require innovative approaches and response mechanisms from IOM and other stakeholders.\n\tUnder the overall supervision of the Chief of Mission (CoM) or the Head of Office in Maiduguri, Nigeria and direct supervision of Programme Manager (Shelter and NFI), and in close coordination with the Regional Thematic Specialist (RTS) at the Regional Office and relevant Divisions/ Departments/ Units at Headquarters (HQ), the Project Assistant - Shelter and Non-Food Items will be responsible and accountable for supporting and coordinating the development, implementation, monitoring and reporting activities of the shelter and settlement programming in Yobe State of Nigeria, both for emergency and transitional programs, including settlement planning, development and improvements.\n\n\nResponsibilities and Accountabilities\n\n\n\tLiaise closely with the Shelter and Settlements Programme Manager throughout the planning, design and implementation stages of the Shelter and Settlements projects.\n\tMonitor and expedite programme implementation of the Shelter and Settlements through project progress trackers, project monitoring tools, discussions and correspondence with project and technical staff, as well as with government authorities and project partners, and through field and project visits. \n\tIn collaboration with technical shelter colleagues and other relevant program units, develop and follow up on implementation plans and monitor the execution of planned Shelter and Settlements activities, to be in line with project deliverables.\n\tSupport in reporting of Shelter and Settlements activities for both internal and external audience, ensure timely preparation and submissions of all project/ programme reports according to IOM and donor formats as required.\n\tUndertake duty travel to conduct regular field visits to project locations to ensure the implementation of Shelter and Settlements activities efficiently, effectively and with flexibility, and to resolve issues identified.\n\tMonitor the use of resources and delivery of Shelter and Settlements project targets and bring to the attention of the project manager delays, bottlenecks, quality, budget or procedural issues, etc., and make recommendations for corrective actions.\n\tPerform other duties as may be assigned.\n\n\nRequirements\nEducational Qualification:\n\n\n\tUniversity Degree in Architectrural Science, Engineering, Building and Construction, Social Science, or an equivalent combination of education, training & experience, or a related field from an accredited academic institution with 1 year of relevant experience.\n\tAccredited Universities are those listed in the UNESCO World Higher Education Database.\n\n\nExperience:\n\n\n\tExperience with supervision roles for tasks of a similar nature to this assignment. \n\tProven experience in project management, budgeting and record keeping.\n\tFive years’ experience required, progressively responsible experience humanitarian assistance\n\tAbility to work under extreme pressure in difficult conditions while maintaining security awareness. \n\tExperience in conflict/emergency zones and in working in a high-risk environment is preferred.\n\tFlexibility and focus on processes and their improvements. \n\n\nSkills:\n\n\n\tExperience with another international organization and knowledge of SAP is an advantage;\n\tExcellent communication and negotiation skills; • Ability to present clear and concise information; Ability to work effectively and harmoniously with colleagues from varied cultures and professional backgrounds;\n\tAbility to meet deadlines and work under pressure;\n\tGood level of computer literacy; personal commitment, efficiency, flexibility, drive for results\n\n\nLanguages:\n\n\n\tFor all applicants, fluency in English is required (oral and written).\n\tIOM’s official languages are English, French and Spanish.\n\tProficiency of language(s) required will be specifically evaluated during the selection process, which may include written and/or oral assessments.\n\n\nRequired Competencies\n\n\n\tIOM’s competency framework can be found at this link.
