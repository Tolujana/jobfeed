You will not just follow instructions; you will figure out how to make the database secure, the logic sound, and the application performant.\n\tRefactor & Ship: You will dive into the existing codebase, clean up the rough edges, optimise the logic, and ship it to production.\n\tSolve Real Problems: You will build features that real people use to buy and rent homes.\n\tLearn Speed: You will work directly with the Co-founders. You will learn how to ship features in days, not months.\n\n\nWho You Are\n\n\n\tYou have built something before: You have shipped working digital products in the past. You have a portfolio that proves you can finish what you start.\n\tYou are a Troubleshooter: When you hit an error, you do not wait for a manager to chase you around. You search for the solution, you read the documentation, and you fix it.\n\tYou are Autonomous: You do not wait to be told how to do your job. You understand the goal and you find the best way to achieve it.\n\tYou want to grow: You see this role as a stepping stone to becoming a Senior Engineer or a CTO one day.\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\tSolid Experience: 3+ years of actual coding experience with a deep understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript and React.\n\tStartup DNA: Experience working in startups or fast-paced environments. You understand that being \"busy\" is different from delivering value.\n\tBackend Familiarity: Experience with backend logic, databases, or tools like Firebase and Supabase.\n\n\nWhy Join Us?\n\n\n\tSalary\n\tImpact: Your code will help Nigerians avoid real estate fraud.\n\tFlexibility: Remote work with a focus on value delivery, not hours logged.\n\n\nMethod of Application\nInterested
