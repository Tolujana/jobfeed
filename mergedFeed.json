Or TypeScript. But probably not CoffeeScript or Dart. Sorry.\n\tContribute to and lead decisions about the right frameworks and libraries to use.\n\tCraft all the appropriate CSS (well, SASS or LESS, of course), knowing that creating maintainable stylesheets means more than good class names (but that, too).\n\tAdd a bit of sizzle and spice to the user experience… We love making sure it all renders pixels perfect!\n\tImplement appropriate web app build tooling, meaning live servers for development, minification and obfuscation for production… you get the idea.\n\tDon’t forget about writing tests. You will definitely be writing automated tests.\n\n\nWhat You Should Have\n\n\n\tCandidates should possess relevant qualifications.\n\t4+ years of experience developing enterprise scale Single-Page Apps (SPAs) and progressive web apps (PWAs) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, etc.\n\tSignificant professional experience with at least one modern JavaScript framework (AngularJS, Ember, React, Vue.js, etc.) - ideally two or three.
