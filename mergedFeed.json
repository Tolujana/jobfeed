assignments.\n\tEnsure the learner’s class setup (Google Meet links, app access, WhatsApp groups, etc.) is correct and tested.\n\tMaintain regular updates with parents in the first 2 weeks of class to ensure satisfaction.\n\tCoordinate replacements or schedule adjustments in collaboration with Operations.\n\n\nSystems & Reporting:\n\n\n\tUpdate and maintain onboarding trackers (tutor, parent, learner).\n\tSend weekly onboarding reports to the COO and Chief of Staff.\n\tIdentify and report patterns or bottlenecks in the onboarding process for system improvement.\n\tSuggest creative ways to improve Brint’s onboarding experience (automations, communication templates, etc.).\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\tBachelor’s Degree in Education, Administration, Human Resources, or related fields.\n\t2–4 years of experience in onboarding, operations, or customer service (preferably in education or tech).\n\tExcellent written and spoken communication skills.\n\tStrong attention to detail, follow-up, and organization.\n\tTech-savvy — comfortable with Google Workspace, WhatsApp Business, CRM tools, or scheduling software.\n\tEmotionally intelligent and professional when interacting with tutors, parents, and staff.\n\tMust be proactive, reliable, and able to work independently in a remote team.\n\n\nWho You Are:\n\n\n\tYou love creating smooth, efficient experiences for others.\n\tYou’re warm, patient, but extremely organized.\n\tYou communicate clearly and professionally.\n\tYou’re comfortable managing multiple moving parts and deadlines.\n\tYou take ownership and pride in doing things right the first time.\n\n\nWhy Join Brint\n\n\n\tSalary: N100,000 / month.\n\tBe part of one of Africa’s fastest-growing global education brands.\n\tWork remotely with a collaborative,

It began as an extension of Tastee Pot, an outdoor catering company serving Nigerian and continental food at special events. The catering company still exists as Tastee Fried Chicken&amp;#39;s catering operation. In 1997 Mrs. Adedayo incorporated Tastee Fried Chicken and opened her first location in Surulere, Lagos State. She based her restaurant on the business model of the American fast food chicken restaurant Kentucky Fried Chicken, where she had previously worked as a manager. Since opening its first location, it has grown to 14 restaurants.\n\nToday, Tastee Fried Chicken has 7TTC(Tastee Turbo Caf&amp;eacute;) with others in different locations across Lagos State and still growing.
